          -----------------------

1. . Find the Largest Number in a List
---------
1. start 
2. int a variable "largest" to the first element of the list (list [0]) 
3. Then we check all the numbers one by one, whichever is largest.
4. After we get the largest number, we will stop at it.
5. End 

--------------------------------------------------

2. Count the Number of Vowels in a String
-----------
1. Start 
2. int a list of vowels 
3. Set a counter variable count to keep track of the number of vowels found.
4. We pass through each character in the input string.
5. Check if the current character is a vowel (i.e., if it's in the list of vowels).
6. If it is a vowel, increment the counter.
7. After finishing the check, print the final count of vowels.

---------------------------------------------------------

3. Reverse a String

--------
1. the inputString holds the original string.
2. The reversedString is initially an empty string and will store the reversed version.
3. The check starts from the last index of the string and moves towards the first index.
4. In each iteration, the current character is added to the reversedString.
5. Finally, after the loop, the reversed string is printed.
