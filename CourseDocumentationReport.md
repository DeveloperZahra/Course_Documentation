## 1. **_Software Development Life Cycle ( SDLC ):_**
Software development life cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that is used to design, develop, and test good-quality software.
SDLC, or software development life cycle, is a methodology that defines the entire procedure of software development step-by-step. 
The goal of the SDLC life cycle model is to deliver high-quality, maintainable software that meets the user’s requirements.
* There are 6 faces for SDLC:
1. **analysis** 
2. **design** 
3. **developme0nt** 
4. **testing** 
5. **deployment** 
6. **maintenance**

* There are several functions that fall under it:  

1. **__Users:__** in Entire Operations, a user ID can be used to enter the system. Several users can log on to Entire Operations with the same user ID and password at the same time. 
For reasons of data security and in order to trace data modifications, however, each user usually has a personal user ID and password. 
User roles are crucial for protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access. By assigning the appropriate roles and permissions, businesses can control who can view, edit, modify, or delete data.
This granular level of control helps maintain data integrity and accuracy.
2. **__Tester:__** evaluating and updating software to ensure it remains functional, secure, and efficient, even after changes or updates.
The role of tester is to validate the system's features, capabilities, and interactions with different components.
3. **__Support managers:__** is a professional responsible for overseeing the maintenance operations of a facility or organization.
They are responsible for ensuring that all maintenance activities are completed in a timely and efficient
The role of support managers is manage and lead a team of customer support representatives, providing guidance, training and performance evaluation to ensure high quality service.
Also supervises the team that interacts directly with customers and follows up on complaints, inquiries and all customer service related matters.

## **__2. Agile Methodology and Scrum framework:__**
* _**Agile:**_ An integrated process that works non-stop and complements each other and is continuous in developing products and releasing new products, allowing for segmentation as it is subject to change with the start of priority.
It is considered more flexible to improve and reprioritize product backlogs so that it always delivers high quality products.
Agile methodology is characterized by its iterative and flexible approach to software development.
It emphasizes collaboration among cross-functional teams and prioritizes adaptability to changing requirements throughout the development process.
* _**Scrum:**__ is a management framework that teams use to self-organize and work towards a common goal.
also  agile project management framework that helps teams structure and manage their work through a set of values, principles, and practices.

## **__3.Git Version Control:__**

Git is a distributed version control system, meaning that it allows developers to work on their own local copies of a project
Git helps manage and track changes to code, but it does so in a decentralized way
This design makes Git fast, scalable, and highly resilient to issues like server failures

* _**Key Features of Git:**__
1. **_Version Tracking:_** Git follows all adjustments done in one record, letting you revert to old releases without trouble.
2. **_Collaboration:_** Different programmers can work on a similar task at the same time without clash.
Branching: You have the option to create distinct branches for new attributes, bug repairs or tests.
3. *__Distributed System:__* Every programmer has an entire version of the project implying that it is decentralized software.
Log of Commits: With this feature, Git maintains an account of all commit actions (changes), 
which makes understanding how a project has evolved over time much easier.

* **_There four main stages in using git as the following:_**

1. **__Working Directory:__** It’s the workspace where the code can be modified and change without any restrictions.

2. 	*__Staging Area:__* It’s the space where the codes are reviewed before saving them as a new copy of the project and also here no modification can be made to the written code.
3. *__Local repo:__* It’s the space where the codes are saved as a new copy of the project and be ready to push to the remote repo.
4. *__Remote Repo:__* It’s a remote space where the main project is stored so that all team members can share their work with the rest of the team and get the latest update from the project.
