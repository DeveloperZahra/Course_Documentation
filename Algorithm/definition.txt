An algorithm is more general and is a step-by-step process based on specific and organized instructions that takes inputs, processes them, and then produces outputs.

One of the most important characteristics that an algorithm must have is that it is correct, clear, and has an end.
 
Algorithms are solved using 
1. pseudocode 
2. flowchart 
3. programming language
